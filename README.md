# Incidence Estimation Tools (*inctools*)

Tools for estimating HIV incidence from biomarker data, and calibrating recent infection tests. This package contains the functionality previously available in the package *ritcalib*.

You can find version 0.9.9 (stable pre-release) under [Releases](https://github.com/SACEMA/inctools/releases).

**Version 1.0.0 will be released shortly and will be available through CRAN.**

We recommend using the latest stable release, rather than the code under development contained in this repository.

Spreadsheet-based tools for inferring incidence using biomarkers for 'recent infection' can be found [here](http://www.incidence-estimation.org/page/tools-for-incidence-from-biomarkers-for-recent-infection).

## About

These tools are released as an R package by the [DST/NRF Centre of Excellence in Epidemiological Modelling and Analysis (SACEMA)](http://www.sacema.org/) in collaboration with the [Consortium for the Evaluation and Performance of HIV Incidence Assays (CEPHIA)](http://www.incidence-estimation.org/page/cephia) and other partners. The package maintainer can be contacted at [eduardgrebe@sun.ac.za](mailto:eduardgrebe@sun.ac.za).
